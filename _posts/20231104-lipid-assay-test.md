## 20231104 Lipid assay test

This protocol was modified from [Bove & Baumann 2021](https://www.protocols.io/view/coral-lipid-assay-for-96-well-plates-q26g789pqlwz/v1) and L. Fuess lipid protocol. I did not test homogenate samples today.

Following my [trial on 10/20], I felt confused as to why some of my standards had failed to develop into a stepwise standard curve. Additionally, since adding half the amount of phosphoric acid seemed to work, I wanted to prepare a trial where I had four sets of standards and added a range of volumes (17.2ul, 24 uL, 31 uL and 34.5 uL). I expected useable standard curves for the addition of 17.2 uL and 24 uL.

Additionally, I remade the vanillin and phosphoric acid. I also recorded the calculations of how to dilute 85% phosphoric acid to 17% phosphoric acid.

## My results were not as expected


## Discussion

A key issue I found in this trial is that during the solvent evaporation, wells evaporated at different rates due to the unevenness of heating in the bead bath. After 15 minutes of solvent evaporation
