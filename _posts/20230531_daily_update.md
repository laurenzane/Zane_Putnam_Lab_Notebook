**Apex:**
Cross calibrating temperature probes:
- Measured 14.99°C on temperature probe
- 14.99°C = 58.982°F
- Manually corrected on Apex Fusion +> probes do not calibrate to less than 60 degrees
- Measured temperature in tank 12 which is much warmer than the other tanks due to the heater 17.83 ° C = 64.094 °F
- Manually corrected on Apex Fusion to 64.1°F
- Moved temperature probes into corresponding tanks and labeled with tape
- Changed alarm from going off when salinity is lower than 32 to 29

**Experimental Setup:**
Set up two tanks for Astrangia collection tomorrow–held at 58°F
