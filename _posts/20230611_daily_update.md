# ***Title: Effect of Early Summer Temperature Simulations on A.poculata Reproduction***

## Authors: Lauren Zane, Hollie Putnam

## Abstract:

- Changing seasonality due to climate change prolongs summers through earlier onsets of summer temperatures as compared to past decades and prolonged maintenance of peak summer temperatures. To investigate the effect of changing seasonality through the reproductive period of Astrangia poculata, exposed Astrangia poculata colonies to ambient seawater conditions and early summer conditions. Through this experiment we were able to investigate the reproductive stage, physiology, lipid content, and lipid composition of the corals in both groups. Results XXX. Discussion XXX.
