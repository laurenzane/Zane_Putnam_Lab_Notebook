**Issues**
Due to the room temperature, the set points of the chillers are not being held
Temperature should increase another 1.6 and 1.2 degrees, which should be held by the chillers
I recalibrated the temperature probes as of this morning 8am to the measured temperature of 60.8 degrees, I replaced temperature probe 11 but I am thinking the PM1 module may be the problem
Temp probe 1 is also not holding the correct temperature
Due to the heat of the chillers, the probe temperatures can be affected by the chillers, I plan on taping the probes to the front of the tank where i take my daily measurements for the most accurate readings
Tank 12 is really hot right now==65 degrees Fahrenheit, may be a chiller failure

Configured Treatment Tanks: 1, 4, 8, 9 ,10, 12 to be set at 63.2 째F, Configured Control Tanks 2,3,5,6,7,11 to be set at 62.4째F

**Tasks**
Daily measurements
Tris calibration
Needs to run from 15째C to 27째C to capture the temperature range for the Puritz Lab
Aquarium cleaning
Updated Github posts through today
