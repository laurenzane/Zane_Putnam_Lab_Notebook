## 20231107 Lipid assay test

This protocol was modified from [Bove & Baumann 2021](https://www.protocols.io/view/coral-lipid-assay-for-96-well-plates-q26g789pqlwz/v1) and L. Fuess lipid protocol. I did not test homogenate samples today.

Following the [lipid assay trials](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-09-26-Lipid-Assay-Test.md?plain=1) completed with Jill, we talked through some troubleshooting steps. We noticed that in previous trials that the addition of phosphoric acid during the second read resulted in overfilled values on the spec for tubes 1-5. In tubes 6 and 7 (7 is the chloroform BLANK), spec values exceeded 3.8, which is almost the maximum value for the spec.

On 11/4, I determined a prime issue--organic solvent contamination from not evaporating the chloroform/methanol solvents completely.

Today, my goal was to run the protocol as stated in our protocol. Previously, I had conducted trials on 10/20 and 11/4 that attempted to add different amounts of phosphoric acid/vanillin. These failed because the organic solvents evaporated at different rates.

## summarizing my results

* Solvent was completely evaporated resulting in a fine white powder. However, I jammed the plate into the beads leading to boiling over of solvents into other wells.

* Sulfuric acid boiled over in PCR plate leading to small total liquid volume.

* after removing from the thermocycler, the wells were nearly dry which was difficult to get enough volume to fill the 96-well plate.

* standard curve did not render.

## next troubleshooting Steps

1. Contact Dr. Bove to ask opinion!
2. place plate on top of beads rather than buried so that solvents don't boil over
3. seal PCR plate in Thermocycler so that sulfuric acid doesn't bubble out
