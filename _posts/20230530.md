### Stir plate sizes:

- Sitr plate diameters 5cm
- Jar used for mock setup is 7 cm in diameter
- Ordered jars with 7.30 cm diameter (2.88 inches wide)-- this should fit most of the coral fragments
- We will not be able to fit 10 containers–8 fits comfortably: 7 corals at a time with one blank
- make sure to measure size of oxygen and temperature sensors NOT just the holes in one of the respo chambers

### Apex Troubleshooting:
- Tested 12 previously used PM1 modules by connecting one by one to Apex base unit
- 11 PM1s worked–turning solid green within a few seconds
- 1 PM1 did not work–remained solid yellow for a few minutes after connecting–removed
- Tested New EB832 by resetting Apex base and connecting PMs, so far a maximum of three PM1s will be recognized on Apex Fusion

### Aquarium Maintenance
- Salinity calibration:
    * Calibrated to 50 us/cm at 25°C
    * First reading: 49.76 us/cm
    * Corrected to 50.00 us/ckm
    * Avg cell cal factor: .469
- pH calibration:
  * Three point calibration: pH 4.01, 7.00 and 10.01 at 25°C
- Daily Measurements for all 12 tanks
  * Created Google Sheet for daily measurements
  * Pushed daily measurements to GH

**pH got less negative as tanks increased from tank ID == 1 to tank ID == 12, keeping an eye on pH probe drift for future daily measurements**
