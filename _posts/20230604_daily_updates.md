**Aquarium maintenance:**
- Set up chillers in control tanks
- Cleaned tank lids
- Cleaned sediment
- Daily measurements
- Pushed to github

**Notes:**
- Due to the ambient temperature in the room, I will need to set up chillers for the rest of the tanks tomorrow–start with bottom tanks, then finish the day with the other two on top

**Temperature notes:**
Starting temperature 58°F +> Start heat ramp on Thursday June 10th
In R: calculate the average temperature on June 10th
Look at 2023 buoy temps and compare
Maximum temperature ambient: 25.7°C == 78.26°F +> reached on July 19th

**Average temp on June 10th:**
- 16.58°C == 61.84°F
**Control and treatment corals will start at this time**

Highest temperatures reached July 19th:
- 25.7°C == 78.26°F
- 27.7°C == 81.86°F

Temp range
- Control: 61.84°F-78.26°F: 16.42
- Treatment: 61.84°F-81.86°F: 20.02
- This is 39 days, every three days is 13
Control:
- 1.25 degrees every mini interval
- 1.2 + 1.3 if Apex cannot control
Treatment:
- 20/13 = 1.5 degrees every mini interval
Set timepoints:
- Timepoints T0 - T5 will be taken approx every ten days
