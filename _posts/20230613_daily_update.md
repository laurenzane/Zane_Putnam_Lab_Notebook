**Probe calibrations:**
Salinity calibration to 50,000 us/cm
**Daily measurements**


**Update Github**
Updated through June 8
Updated PR data

**Notes:**

Overnight, temperatures remained around 61.2°F and 61.6°F for treatment and control tanks but today, tank number 4 has reached 62 degrees. I turned the temperature down but this chiller does not hold the set point temperature…

Temperature probe 11 reads 63.5°F but the measured temperature is 60.2°F. I recalibrated the probe twice but the temperature is still reading above 63°. I replaced the probe with one from the Puritz lab. If it continues to read incorrectly, I will replace the PM1 module with a new one.

Tomorrow, I will increase the temperatures to 62.4 °F for the control and 63.2 °F for the treatment and continuously monitor the tanks. I am hoping that the separation between the two treatments will be more obvious as the water temperatures will then be close enough to what the chillers can physically accomplish.
