## 20231114 Lipid assay test

This protocol was modified from [Bove & Baumann 2021](https://www.protocols.io/view/coral-lipid-assay-for-96-well-plates-q26g789pqlwz/v1) and L. Fuess lipid protocol. I did not test homogenate samples today.

On 11/4, I determined a prime issue--organic solvent contamination from not evaporating the chloroform/methanol solvents completely.

Today, my goal was to run the protocol as stated in our protocol. Previously, I had conducted trials on 10/20 and 11/4 that attempted to add different amounts of phosphoric acid/vanillin. These failed because the organic solvents evaporated at different rates.

The major changes taking place in this protocol test:
1. evaporating solvent on top of the bead bath rather than buried in it prevent bubbling over
2. using a pcr plate sealant so that sulfuric acid doesn't bubble out

## summarizing my results

* Solvent was evaporated in a predictable manner, see gradient of oil amounts

* Sulfuric acid addition.

* after removing from the thermocycler, the wells were fully liquid but very, very dark.

## next troubleshooting Steps

1. Contact Dr. Bove to ask opinion! [she did not repond to me]
2. check original L. Fuess protocol to see if there is anything wrong?
