## Objective: document AI light settings used for my Summer 2023 experiment, Early Summer, based on Jill's settings for her 2021 experiment

* based on J. Ashey's PI curve for the corals, she found that the corals maxxed out at 20% light intensity
* she based the timing of the lights on the times of day of sunrise and sunset

_** AI Light Settings **_

* 20% for all colors, except UV (0%)
* lights come on at 6am
* 4 hour to max light
* 4 hour ramp down
* 6pm lights turn off
