- For each coral being shipped you will need:
  - at least 10 rubber bands
  - two plastic shipping bags
  - one piece of styrofoam to float the coral
- take care to remove previous shipping labels and other information on shippiung boxes
- be sure to schedule a pickup (see )
- try to avoid shipping corals in the summer--temperatures in the box can reach up to 52Â°C
  - if corals must be shipped in the summer corals can be shipped with an ice pack if they are traveling a short distance ie: URI to UPenn
- during winter months, corals can be shipped with a heat pack
